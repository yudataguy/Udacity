# Wrange OpenStreetMap Data #

### Project Overview: ###

Choose any area of the world in https://www.openstreetmap.org and use data munging techniques, such as assessing the quality of the data for validity, accuracy, completeness, consistency and uniformity, to clean the OpenStreetMap data for a part of the world that you care about. Finally, choose either MongoDB or SQL as the data schema to complete the project.

### Map Choice: ###

Map link:

Map extract:
https://mapzen.com/data/metro-extracts/metro/shanghai_china/

Shagnhai is one of the major cities in China, with millions of residents. 
I picked “Shanghai, China” as the metropolitan area due to its size and relative smaller user base, in anticipation of possible errors and inconsistency.
